# Experimental results
This folder consists of python files for answering four research questions.

## Steps
1. Setting the absolute path in _z_config.txt_
    - Just copy and paste a set of paths from the 1_dataset_generation folder z_config.
2. Execute each file to answer each RQ
    1) **rq#_data.py**: extract the result data for rq# (output: _result_rq#.txt_)
    2) **rq#_result.py**: print the experimental result for each RQ
    3) **rqs_data_statistics.py**: print the statistics based on four result_rq#.txt
