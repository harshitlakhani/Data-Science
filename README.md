# IRBL for DLSW
This repository is a reproduction package for IRBL for DLSW projects.

For data generation, scoring, and answering RQs, we separated all tasks arranged in alphabetical order. This separation can also reduce production errors when dealing with large amounts of the dataset. In addition, if you are curious about each operation, it will be easy to look at each file.

## Preparation
- Environments: Python 3.8 + 22icst.yaml
- Download Denchmark-BRs
    - https://github.com/RosePasta/Denchmark_BRs
- Download Commit/hunk dataset generated by Locus
    - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S0aJE3alsTjB5Uy3j9ENemKtbcx3yzVc/view?usp=sharing

## Structure
Each folder information is provided on Readme.md of each folder.

```
IRBL for DLSW
│   README.md
│   22icst.yaml
└───1_dataset_generation
└───2_scoring
└───3_experimental_results
```

These folders consist of Python files for the tasks below.

## 1_dataset_generation
1) download git repository and extract released versions
2) generate bug reports and search space (both source files and functions)
3) extract specific textual information by regular expression and HTML header
4) preprocess the bug report for query
5) preprocess source files/functions for search space
6) generate ground truth files and functions
7) generate commit history for only python files

## 2_scoring
1) compute the similarity between bug reports and source files by three IR models (VSM, rVSM, BM25)
    - rVSM reference: Where should the bugs be fixed? more accurate information retrieval-based bug localization based on bug reports, ICSE'12
2) compute stack trace scores
    - reference: Boosting bug-report-oriented fault localization with segmentation and stack-trace analysis, ICSME'14
3) compute commit scores
    - reference: Improved bug localization based on code change histories and bug reports, IST'17
4) compute the similarity between bug reports and hunks
    - reference: Locus: Locating bugs from software changes, ASE'16
5) compute the similarity between a bug report and historical bug reports
    - reference: Where should the bugs be fixed? more accurate information retrieval-based bug localization based on bug reports, ICSE'12
6) compute function suspiciousness
7) compute query type-based suspiciousness

## 3_experimental results
- Answer four research questions
- You can download the files for the results noted in paper from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BpUQboHl8ctKXSxI7FasPGogXUt1O7Uo/view?usp=sharing
