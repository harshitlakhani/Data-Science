      Unify the check point of single and multi GPU          save the model.hyp etc to checkpoint when use multi GPU training 
     model.hyp = hyp  # attach hyperparameters to model      model.gr = 1.0  # giou loss ratio (obj_loss = 1.0 or giou)      model.class_weights = labels_to_class_weights(dataset.labels, nc).to(device)  # attach class weights     model.names = data_dict['names']        # Class frequency      labels = np.concatenate(dataset.labels, 0)
