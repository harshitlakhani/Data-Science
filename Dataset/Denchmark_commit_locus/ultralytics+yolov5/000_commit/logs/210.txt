      W&B ID reset on training completion  (#1852)          * Update train.py          Fix the bug of always the same W&B ID  and continue  overwrite with the old logging.     BUG report     https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/1851          * Fix the bug of duplicate W&B ID          fix the bug of https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/1851     If we had trained on yolov5s.pt, the program will generate a new unique W&B ID.     If we hadn't, the program will keep the old code, we can still use --resume aug.          * Update general.py          * revert train.py changes          Co-authored-by: Glenn Jocher <glenn.jocher@ultralytics.com>
