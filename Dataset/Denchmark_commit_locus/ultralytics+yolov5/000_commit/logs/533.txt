      Default optimize_for_mobile() on TorchScript models (#2908)          Per https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/script_optimized.html this should improve performance on torchscript models (and maybe coreml models also since coremltools operates on a torchscript model input, though this still requires testing). 
         print(f'\n{prefix} starting export with torch {torch.__version__}...')          f = opt.weights.replace('.pt', '.torchscript.pt')  # filename          ts = torch.jit.trace(model, img, strict=False)         ts = optimize_for_mobile(ts)  # https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/script_optimized.html          ts.save(f)          print(f'{prefix} export success, saved as {f}')      except Exception as e:
