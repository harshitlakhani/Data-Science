      [bug fix] potential problem if img fed to model is in rectangular shape 
 def scale_coords(img1_shape, coords, img0_shape, ratio_pad=None):      # Rescale coords (xyxy) from img1_shape to img0_shape      if ratio_pad is None:  # calculate from img0_shape         gain = max(img1_shape) / max(img0_shape)  # gain  = old / new         gain = min(img1_shape[0] / img0_shape[0], img1_shape[1] / img0_shape[1])  # gain  = old / new          pad = (img1_shape[1] - img0_shape[1] * gain) / 2, (img1_shape[0] - img0_shape[0] * gain) / 2  # wh padding      else:          gain = ratio_pad[0][0]
