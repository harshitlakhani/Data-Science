      Slightly modify CLI execution (#3687)          * Slightly modify CLI execution          This simple change makes it easier to run the primary functions of this     repo (train/detect/test) from within Python. An object which represents     `opt` can be constructed and fed to the `main` function of each of these     modules, rather than having to call the lower level functions directly,     or run the module as a script.          * Update export.py          Add CLI parsing update for more convenient module usage within Python.
