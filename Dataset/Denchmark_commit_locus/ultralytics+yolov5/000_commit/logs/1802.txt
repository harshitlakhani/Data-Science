      Move hyp and opt yaml save to top of train()          Fixes bug where scaled values were saved in hyp.yaml, which would cause continuity issues with --resume 
     best = wdir + 'best.pt'      results_file = log_dir + os.sep + 'results.txt'       # Save run settings     with open(Path(log_dir) / 'hyp.yaml', 'w') as f:         yaml.dump(hyp, f, sort_keys=False)     with open(Path(log_dir) / 'opt.yaml', 'w') as f:         yaml.dump(vars(opt), f, sort_keys=False)               epochs = opt.epochs  # 300      batch_size = opt.batch_size  # 64      weights = opt.weights  # initial training weights
