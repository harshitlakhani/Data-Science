      pretrained model loading bug fix (#450)          Signed-off-by: Glenn Jocher <glenn.jocher@ultralytics.com> 
     # Since I see lots of print here, the logging configuration is skipped here. We may see repeated outputs.        # Configure     init_seeds(2+local_rank)     init_seeds(2 + local_rank)      with open(opt.data) as f:          data_dict = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)  # model dict      train_path = data_dict['train']
